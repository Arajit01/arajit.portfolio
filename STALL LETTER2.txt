I am astonished by the doubt cast upon the authenticity of my original letter, and I am deeply offended by the additional accusation of engaging a credit repair company.

I understand that you have been using generic form letters to respond to various complaints and challenges from consumers, regardless of the specific details they have provided. 

This practice is unlawful, as each dispute and challenge should be individually addressed and evaluated on its own merits.

The letters I sent were generated using widely available software. Refusing to process these letters would be a violation of 15 U.S. Code 5 1681i. It is important to note that you are not permitted to delay the processing of consumer letters based on the assumption that assistance from a third party might be involved. 

Such an exception is not legally acceptable.

Any letters bearing my name that you receive were authored by me or my advisors, with my full knowledge and consent. There is no legal requirement for a Power of Attorney to be provided in order to delay the processing of consumer letters.

Failure to process my letters promptly will be regarded as a deliberate disregard for my rights as a consumer. In such a case, I will contact my attorney to initiate legal proceedings.
